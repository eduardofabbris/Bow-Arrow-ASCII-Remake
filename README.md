# Bow-Arrow-ASCII-Remake

Bow and arrow is a 1992 arcade genre game released for DOS, where the player controls a bowman and has to shoot multiple moving targets and avoid obstacles with a limit number of arrows.

This adaptation was initially developed as my first major C project back in my first college year, when I had the first contact with C and algorithms. Needless to say, it isn't the most optimized or efficient code. Furthermore, I have recently made a few modification in order to allow the game to be compiled for Linux as well and added a few comments to better identify each function.

## Compilation:

## How to Play:

* Use the arrow keys or W/S to move the archer upwards and downwards;
* Fire the available arrows(displayed in the game above) using space;
* Avoid the collision with monsters and spending all the available arrows, which will end the game;
* Destroy the most balloons and monster as possible using the least amount of arrows to obtain greater scores;
* Only the tip of the arrow is effective on destroying the balloons;
* The selected difficulty level will modify the arrow fire rate speed and the archer, balloons and monsters movement speeds, enabling a more challenging or easy game.
