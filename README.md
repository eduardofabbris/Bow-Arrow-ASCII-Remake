# Bow-and-Arrow-ASCII-Remake

Bow and arrow is a 1992 arcade genre game released for DOS, where the player controls a bowman and has to shoot multiple moving targets and avoid obstacles with a limited number of arrows.

This adaptation was initially developed as my first major C project during my first year of college, when I was introduced to C and algorithms. Needless to say, it isn't the most optimized or efficient code. Furthermore, I have recently made a few modifications in order to allow the game to be compiled for Linux as well and added a few comments to better identify each function.

## Compilation :rocket:

### Linux:

```bash
make
```

### Windows:

Using MinGW, execute "windows\_build.bat"


## How to Play :pencil:

* Use the arrow keys or w/s to move the archer upwards and downwards;
* Fire the available arrows(displayed in the game above) using space;
* Avoid collisions with monsters and spending all the available arrows, which will end the game;
* Destroy as many balloons and monsters as possible using the fewest arrows to achieve higher scores;
* Only the tip of the arrow is effective on destroying the balloons;
* The selected difficulty level will modify the arrow fire rate speed and the archer, balloons and monsters movement speeds, enabling a more challenging or easier game.
